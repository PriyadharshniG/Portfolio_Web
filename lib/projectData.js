      "Engineered a machine learning solution to detect anomalies in cellular tower network data using real-time analytics. Leveraged Python with scikit-learn and Pandas for data preprocessing and model training, and integrated interactive dashboards using Streamlit for visual monitoring. The model identifies unusual patterns in traffic, latency, or signal strength, enabling proactive maintenance and reduced downtime.",
